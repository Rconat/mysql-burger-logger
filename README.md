## Usage 

The "Eat-Da-Burger!" application allows users to input any type of burger they would like to try and will save it to the site. Once the burger is saved to the site the users will be given a button to "devour it!" which will move the burger over to the devoured burgers side denoting that it has been devoured. All data will be stored in a database.
